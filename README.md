## Booking a table on the Little Lemon website

### Problem definition
Little Lemon currently offers no way for diners to reserve a table directly from its mobile website, 
forcing patrons to call the restaurant or arrive in person and risk waiting. This absence of a mobile-friendly
booking flow inconveniences guests—who increasingly expect quick, self-service reservations—adds call volume
and administrative burden for staff during peak periods, and leaves the restaurant vulnerable to losing business
to competitors with seamless digital systems. The objective is to design and prototype a compelling, 
branded “Reserve a Table” experience that streamlines the booking process, delights users with intuitive
interactions and subtle animations, and converts casual browsers into confirmed reservations while meeting
modern accessibility and performance standards.
