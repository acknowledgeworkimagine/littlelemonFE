## Booking a table on the Little Lemon website

### Problem
Little Lemon currently offers no way for diners to reserve a table directly from its mobile website, 
forcing patrons to call the restaurant or arrive in person and risk waiting. This absence of a mobile-friendly
booking flow inconveniences guests—who increasingly expect quick, self-service reservations—adds call volume
and administrative burden for staff during peak periods, and leaves the restaurant vulnerable to losing business
to competitors with seamless digital systems. The objective is to design and prototype a compelling, 
branded “Reserve a Table” experience that streamlines the booking process, delights users with intuitive
interactions and subtle animations, and converts casual browsers into confirmed reservations while meeting
modern accessibility and performance standards.

### Wireframe
A wireframe is a low-fidelity prototype used in rapid prototyping to outline the basic structure and layout of a digital product. 
It focuses on the placement and hierarchy of content and functionality, allowing designers to test main features and user interactions
early in the process. Wireframes help teams quickly visualize ideas, collect feedback, and make improvements before investing 
time and money in full development.

### Prototype
A prototype is a scaled-down version of a product used to test ideas, functionality, and user interactions before full development. 
It can range from a simple paper sketch to a fully interactive digital model. Prototypes help teams identify usability issues early, 
gather feedback from users or stakeholders, and improve the design quickly and cost-effectively.
